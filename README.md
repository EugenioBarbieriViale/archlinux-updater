# Update Arch Linux weekly

You can specify on which day of the week you want to update your system and this program will do it weekly.

To do so, change the `WEEK_DAY_UPDATE` variable in `system-update.cpp`.

Compile the program in your home directory, keep `database.log` in its same dir and add `./a.out` to your `.bashrc`.
